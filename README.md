# NotWallpapers
A small program that I made to clean up my wallpapers folder, it moves all images that are not a specific aspect ratio to another folder.

# Usage
Simply run the program in a directory full of images and it will move all images that are not 16:9 aspect ratio to a folder called notwallpapers one directory up.

Alternatively you can pass arguments to specify the input folder, output folder and aspect ratio.

## NotWallpapers.bat
>NotWallpapers.exe C:\wallpapers C:\notwallpapers 0.5625
